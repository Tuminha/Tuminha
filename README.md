👋 Hi there! I'm Francisco, known as @Tuminha in the GitHub universe.
🦷 By day, I'm a dedicated dentist making the world smile one patient at a time.
🎸 By night, I'm a passionate guitar player creating melodies that inspire.
💡 I'm fascinated by technology, and I'm currently on a journey to become a self-taught developer.
👨‍💻 My interests span across HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Solidity, and more. I'm always up for learning something new!
🌍 As a natural communicator, I thrive in social media and marketing. I also love lecturing and sharing my knowledge with others.
🤝 I'm open to collaborations and love being part of the open-source community.
🌱 Currently, I'm working on a project, Periospot 3.0, combining blockchain technology and dentistry - yes, you read that right!
📫 Feel free to reach me at cisco@periospot.com or drop a comment on my latest commits.
